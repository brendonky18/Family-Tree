1 CONT 
1 CONT Malden High School seniors are now moving on to the next stage of thei
1 CONC r lives, after graduating on Sunday, June 3rd. Finishing their last exam
1 CONC s in high school to enjoy their last day of school and prom, Malden Hig
1 CONC h seniors have been ending their school year with many unforgettable mem
1 CONC ories to continue on with them once they officially graduate.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Graduation, the last memory of senior year, is an important milestone fo
1 CONC r seniors. Friends, families, and faculty gathered on Sunday, June 3 a
1 CONC t McDonald’s Stadium in Malden for the ceremony.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Graduation was crowded with families filling the bleachers, along with c
1 CONC oncession stands hosted by other MHS students selling food, drinks and o
1 CONC ther items while the staff and graduates prepare for the upcoming event.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Graduation featured a performance from Malden’s Choral Arts, Band, and s
1 CONC peeches from principals and important city officials. Students were the
1 CONC n presented their diplomas.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Members of Malden’s faculty such as Judi Sullivan, Chris Mastrangelo, th
1 CONC e current principal of MHS, and Kate Haskell, the senior class advisor
1 CONC , spent much of their efforts and dedication into creating a successfu
1 CONC l graduation for the seniors.  Judi Sullivan helped prepare for the even
1 CONC t and has been for many years with duties such as handing out diplomas.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Malden student body can all agree that the graduation of 2018 is a s
1 CONC ignificant event considering many of their peers are done with high scho
1 CONC ol. To congratulate the graduates, Mastrangelo delivered a moving and in
1 CONC spiring speech to the graduation attendees and reminded the Malden commu
1 CONC nity the brightness of its future and past.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Mastrangelo mentioned that the class of 2018 was a great class with thei
1 CONC r impact on the underclassman as well as their leadership role in thei
1 CONC r community. Mastrangelo later delivered a moving and inspiring speech t
1 CONC o the graduation attendees and reminded the Malden community the brightn
1 CONC ess of its future.
1 CONT 
1 CONT With the guidance counselors being a important part of student lives, Er
1 CONC in Craven mentions that  “We work with each student to make sure they ha
1 CONC ve the necessary courses and requirements fulfilled to earn their diplom
1 CONC a.”
1 CONT 
1 CONT Along with the staff members of MHS, there were also speeches conducte
1 CONC d by Mayor Gary Christenson, Steve Ultrino State Representative,  and Jo
1 CONC hn Oteri Superintendent of schools all wishing the students well in th
1 CONC e future.
1 CONT 
1 CONT For seniors, graduation is a changing point in their lives, and many o
1 CONC f the graduates are going to different colleges or universities. There w
1 CONC ere four speeches given in representation of the graduating class. The
1 CONC y were given by Manuel Queasda Nylen, president of the class of 2018, Or
1 CONC ator Cindy Siu, Salutatorian Hong Li Zheng, and Valedictorian Matthew Ch
1 CONC in.  Each of their speeches were unique, including popular songs, person
1 CONC al experiences, and even friend shout-outs.
1 CONT 
1 CONT On the field, the graduates have many mixed emotions. Graduate Jenny Huy
1 CONC nh mentioned that although she is sad that she is leaving everyone, sh
1 CONC e is also very happy and satisfied that graduation will be a good end t
1 CONC o a chapter of her life; she will also miss the staff members of high sc
1 CONC hool as well as her friends.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Other graduates express similar feelings, like graduate Karina Bressan
1 CONC , when she says “[she] feel[s] really good, [she] feel[s] successful an
1 CONC d accomplished.” She also includes that she will miss her friends and th
1 CONC e Malden community as a whole.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Graduate Fatima Zahra Lhaloui states that “[graduation is] long overdue
1 CONC , and [she] feel[s] like [the graduates] worked hard to get where [they
1 CONC ] are and [she’s] glad that everyone is graduating together.” She descri
1 CONC bes the moment as bittersweet, commenting that she won’t allow herself t
1 CONC o “cry until after [she] gets her diploma.”
1 CONT 
1 CONT Lhaloui’s eagerness to depart from high school is corroborated by othe
1 CONC r graduates, including Graduate Ramon Aguinaldo, who says he “feel[s] am
1 CONC azing,” going even further as to say that he feels “like the shackles ha
1 CONC ve been loosened and are gone, [he] feel[s] free.” Still, he acknowledge
1 CONC s that leaving and going out into the “real world”, where he “won’t se
1 CONC e so much color will be kind of hard,” given that diversity is embrace
1 CONC d at MHS while some colleges have very different demographics.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Graduate Frida Torres says that despite her fear she’ll fall on the stag
1 CONC e, she’s “really excited because [she’s] graduating, and [she] feels lik
1 CONC e this is a great achievement in [her] life and [she’s] really thankfu
1 CONC l for all the teachers” and mentors who helped her throughout high schoo
1 CONC l. Torres will be attending MAssachusetts College of Art and Design (Mas
1 CONC sArt) in the fall.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Graduate Alicia Tan expresses the same gratitude towards others when sh
1 CONC e says “[she’d] like to thank all [her] teachers who didn’t give up on [
1 CONC her], even when [she] was going to give up on [herself] .”
1 CONT 
1 CONT Graduates plan on attending colleges across the nation, trade schools, t
1 CONC aking gap years, and some even plan on serving in the military. Their wi
1 CONC llingness to serve was recognized during the ceremony, as was the dedica
1 CONC tion of many students who were awarded Alumni Scholarships by Greg Luce
1 CONC y of the Malden Alumni Association.
1 CONT 
1 CONT As the seniors tossed their caps into the air, graduation came to an en
1 CONC d and the families of the seniors joined them on the field for photos an
1 CONC d well wishes. Congratulations to the Class of 2018 for their hard wor
1 CONC k and perseverance.
